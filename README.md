In this project you will extend the software application you developed in project 3 to be accessible on the web. You will achieve this using Docker and Flask. 
Docker provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. 
Docker is currently an industry-leading tool for developing containerized software applications. 
Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework that allows developers to create web applications using Python.

Your flask application will get user input from a web form instead of the console like you used in project 3. 
You will also write code to populate an option box with stock symbols for the user to choose from. Your application should not crash.

Teams should work together as a team on this project but everyone will submit their work individually. 
This project does not have to be managed in Jira. 
The team should work together in helping each other to understand Docker, Flask, how to implement your code, and develop a solution to populate the stock options.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to gain more knowledge and experience working in the Docker and Flask environments to produce a working software application.

Scenario
The professor you created the python application for loved it!
He just wishes that he did not have to run it from the command line and that there was some sort of user interface. 
A teammate of yours suggests converting the app into a web app using Flask since the application is written in python. 
The app will also be deployed in a Docker container.

Your teammate went ahead and created the web form in Flask and inside a Docker container. 
You now have to add your python code to query the Alpha VantageLinks to an external site. 
api and display the chart in the browser to make the web app fully functional. You also have to write code to populate the stock symbols in the web app.
